       "4  Restaurant quality! I used 3 cans of clams instead of 2 and was perfect!! Not sure why others have said it was salty. Even using all the clam juice I still had to add salt. Maybe the salt pork is saltier than bacon? The 2 T of cornstarch was better for me because it made it the perfect consistency. I also used half and half, not milk. I&#039;ve done this in crock pot and stove top and it turned out better on stove top. I don&#039;t think things thicken up as well in the crock pot. GREAT clam chowder and so simple!  "
