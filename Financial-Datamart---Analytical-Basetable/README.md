The goal of the project is to create a financial base table using customer data and report insightful information. The objective of creating the basetable is to use it for further data analysis and modelling and predicting the future behaviour of clients.
We have used different customer data that has been provided in the form of various tables like loan, account, credit card, daily transactions, demographics, disposition, orders, and client information.
This entire project has been done with Python and visualizations has been done using Plotly.
