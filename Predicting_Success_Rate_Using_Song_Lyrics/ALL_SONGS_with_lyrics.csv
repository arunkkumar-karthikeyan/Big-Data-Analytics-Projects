Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, ""Shoot your shot"" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that

Told Lee he'd be a millionaire

Holidays in California, quite strange
The height change but the sight same
I'm just adjustin' to the price change
The truth is I'm just in a better price range
The Saint Laurents at the dice game
That's just fly talk, that's just sky slang
I'm just ballin', I'm ballin, I'm really ballin'
Strip club like I'm tryna win a Heisman
The applause first, then the spite came
Tryna kill my pain in the Sprite can
The top off in a strange way, I'm tryna fight fame

[Pre-Chorus: SAINt JHN]
Am I still sharin' my location with you?
Feels like I'm on probation with you
Too hard to have a rotation with you
I love you on occasion but you
Fuck it up way too much
Fuck it up way too much
You like to fight too much
You like to play too rough

I like when you're short skirt and your heels
And you're not in your feels
I cover the bills
Oh, what a thrill, what a thrill
If you call and I don't reply
And you text and I just don't answer
It don't mean that I changed my mind
It just means that I don't pay ransom
You walk out and you don't say bye
And I don't wanna speak out of anger
I won't be held for ransom
I'm too handsome
Yeah

What you say on the way, tryna pray, have faith
From the temple, extra ordinary brain, gotta say, ayy
You look so excited, I can tell by your face
But to me it's just an ordinary day
You want me to take a vacation with you
You just better hope I stay patient with you
We gon' need some de-escalation, can you talk to me nice?
I got you a gift, but you fuck it up way too much
The situation way too us, won't peace like deuce up, why your dukes up?
I'm tryna drown my pain in a fuckin' two cup
Lost too many niggas, I ain't tryna lose touch

Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road

We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom

Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo, James
Bond, Hot Pockets in the microwave

You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go

I swear I liked her until I thought about you, you

And I like no one more than you

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

So live a life you will remember

Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars

Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

She wore white that day
Her hair up, the most beautiful she ever felt
She gave her heart that day
You promised it'd be safe in your arms
And you'll never let it go to waste
With everyone she loved by the water
She wore white that day
She was your everything
First sight from the moment on the summer night
But she couldn't stay
So you planned out all your life in your letters
Up until that winter's day
You took a plane so you would be together
She was your everything

[Chorus]
Now tell her what's changed between good and goodbye
Why you tryin' everything to walk out of her life?
If you leave now, don't leave her with the blame
You know she's gonna take it anyway
Tell her what's changed

Can you find yourself?
Think twice about everything before you go
Can you remind yourself?
If you break it, it always will be broken
Can you see the consequences
Of leaving all these words unspoken?
Can you find yourself?

Trip down the road, walking you home
You kiss me at your door
Pulling me close, beg me stay over
But I'm over this roller coaster

I'ma crawl out the window now
Getting good at saying, ""Gotta bounce""
Honestly, you always let me down
And I know we're not just hanging out

Nineteen, but you act twenty-five now
Knees weak, but you talk pretty fly, wow
Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

Where is my angel?
The end of a tiring day
Someone come and save me, please
Is overshadowed by a sigh
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The tears reflected in the mirror mean
My colors hid in the smile, blue and grey

[Verse 1: SUGA]
I really don’t know what went wrong
I grew up with a blue question mark in my mind
Maybe that’s why I’ve been fighting for my life
But looking behind, I’m standing here dazed
The powerful shadow swallows me
The question mark is still blue
Is it anxiety or depression?
Am I just an animal that regrets
Or is it me born out of loneliness?
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't get eaten away, I'll find the exit

[Chorus: Jin, Jung Kook, Jimin, V]
I just wanna be happier
Melt me, I'm cold
I've reached out my hand countless times
The echo is colorless
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook & Jin, Jimin & V]
I still feel my heart
Breathe faster like when
I walked on the cold winter streets
Don't say you're fine
'Cause you're not
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

[Verse 2: j-hope, RM]
The road I always walk and the light I always receive
But today seems like an unfamiliar scene
Have I become used to it or have I collapsed?
This piece of metal does feel heavy
A grey rhino approaches
I just stand there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like 'color' embarrass me
The wide grey zone is comfortable
With hundreds of millions of grey faces
When it rains, I dance
Over this city, my world
Raise a toast to
The fog on clear days
And all the dust always
Here with me on rainy days

[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, V, Jin]
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth in my hands
They're cold, that's why I need more of you
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future far away
I'll tell you that I did

But I deserved it, they knocked me out

'Cause someone will, but you need to love yourself

Young Thug),"[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)

I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

17
A collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real-life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally
And I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen
I do not value your money; I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this
In the hopes that it will help cure, or at least numb your depression

Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)

We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

You don't really look at me the way you used to
And I'm hoping it ain't true

Say you were off with someone that I don't know
Callin' other people on your telephone
Kinda wish I didn't know

Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you

As you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight?

[Verse 2]
You tell me it ain't what it seems
But, baby, this is lookin' like a crime scene
There's clothes thrown on the balcony
And you smell like perfume out a magazine
I'm throwing all your shit outta my window
Telling you I wish that we had never spoke
Baby, I already know

Someone I've not met before
They've got eyes like mine, a pretty smile
And they've been crying for a while

That our lover loved us both

But, baby, you ain't have to let me down (Let me down)
And I know you were never really there (Really there)
But I feel like you really always cared (Always cared)
But don't bother (Oh, oh, oh, oh), I know you wanna hit my line
But I will never let you waste my time
But I wonder (Oh, oh, oh, oh), tell me, is it right?
Tell me, is it true? Something you despise?

[Verse 1: TyFontaine]
Oh, you despise me? That's more than likely
Commas on my ass and they pricey
And I don't need to know, you could advise me
That man just a couple reasons why they do not like me
Hey, we be with they bitches and they lickin' up our ice cream
And a bitch can't break my heart 'cause the shit too god damn icy
We ain't made no vows, when we go to wifey?
I cannot do that, I don't trust you the slightest
These emotions that I fight with, things that are a virus
Will you be there in the end? Just tell me if you riding
Will you be there in the end? Just tell me what you finding
If you there until the end, just tell me if you like it

Hey, so why you comfortable? Baby, you're like me
I had to pick your heart out like a type beat (Yeah)
I was diggin' at her love like I'm mining (Yeah)
She the type to take away my timing
Finding, finding who I really am
Lying, lying, I know what you're saying
Trying, trying, I know I can make it
No crying, crying, I swear that I ain't simping
I had a hard time tryna find why I
Feeling I might die, feel like the time's right
And it's been such a long time since I felt alright
I've been alone and you've been alone, so what's right?

[Verse 1: TyFontaine]
Oh, you despise me? That's more than likely
Commas on my ass and they pricey
And I don't need to know, you could advise me
That man just a couple reasons why they do not like me
Hey, we be with they bitches and they lickin' up our ice cream
And a bitch can't break my heart 'cause the shit too god damn icy
We ain't made no vows, when we go to wifey?
I cannot do that, I don't trust you the slightest
These emotions that I fight with, things that are a virus
Will you be there in the end? Just tell me if you riding
Will you be there in the end? Just tell me what you finding
If you there until the end, just tell me if you like it

[Verse 2: TheHxliday]
Hey, so why you comfortable? Baby, you're like me
I had to pick your heart out like a type beat (Yeah)
I was diggin' at her love like I'm mining (Yeah)
She the type to take away my timing
Finding, finding who I really am
Lying, lying, I know what you're saying
Trying, trying, I know I can make it
No crying, crying, I swear that I ain't simping
I had a hard time tryna find why I
Feeling I might die, feel like the time's right
And it's been such a long time since I felt alright
I've been alone and you've been alone, so what's right?

I don't know nothin' about the service
The clergy do in the churches
I never read the book, though I knew the pages were turnin'
I tried to sing the hymns, but I couldn't think of the verses
Tried to confess my sins, but I didn't know how to word it
But this is my sermon, firstly I'm emotionally drained
Self-medicatin', hopin' I can cope with the pain
I need a fix 'cause that'll fix whatever's broke in my brain
Who am I kiddin'? No, I'm goin' insane
I wrote some quotes on this page
Just trying to reach you and I hope you relate
Well, I'll probably just throw them away
'Cause I don't know what to say
I feel weak when I'm supposed to be brave
I seem free, but I'm enclosed in a cage
Do I continue to ponder over the past
Thinkin' I could've done it better?
Do I whimper from the future
And buckle under the pressure?
Or do I step to the plate, and go take the chance with my life
Come face to face with the darkness
So I can stand in the light, like…

When I feel your love upon me
I know that I am truly blessed
Sometimes you've gotta face the darkness
To step into the light again

I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never

I got so many hits, can't remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin' a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain't really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?

Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again

This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands

She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one

Mm, mm, mm
Mm

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I'm only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can't remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin' a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain't really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know

Yeah

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl (Oh)
It's time for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (Ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (Ooh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande, with Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind (I don't mind, I don't mind)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, with Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]
Mmm (Sheesh, woo)
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said, said, ayy)
Is it real this time or is it in my head? (In my head, oh, in my head, head, yeah)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

[Bridge: Ariana Grande, with Ty Dolla $ign]
(Yeah)
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away

[Chorus: Ariana Grande with Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, you got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
(With no safety net, oh-ah, baby)
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said)
Is it real this time or is it in my head?

[Intro]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
(Rudeboyz)
La conocí en Medallo, ella prendiendo un blunt, yeh-yeh (Blunt; yeh-yeh)
Estaba ready pa' echarle la bendición, amén (Jajaja)

[Coro]
Solo bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino (Yeh)
Solo nos bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino, mami

[Verso 1]
Es que tú eres adictiva
Me gusta más que Little Wayne a la codeína (Codeína)
Me pregunto si como camina, así cocina
Baby, vamo' pa' encima
Aunque no tenga punchline yo siempre encuentro la rima' (La rima')

[Pre-Coro]
Te comí completa aunque estabas a dieta
Me saliste perra aunque te hiciste la discreta
Perdón si malinterpreta'
Pero es que la neta
Está má' dura que Niágara en bicicleta

[Coro]
So-So-Solo bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino (Yeh)
Solo nos bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino, mami

[Verso 2]
Parcera, ¿cómo fue?
Fanática de Jordan 23
Pero de Maluma a los dieciséis
Chulita, qué bien te ve'
Sin maquillaje siempre a la fresh
Famosa pero no sale en TV

[Pre-Coro]
Te comí completa aunque estabas a dieta
Me saliste perra aunque te hiciste la discreta
Perdón si malinterpreta'
Pero es que la neta (Órale)
Está má' dura que Niágara en bicicleta

[Coro]
So-So-Solo bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino (Yeh)
Solo nos bastaron dos copas de vino
No fue casualidad, son cosa' del destino
Los do' no' encontramo' en mitad del camino
Nadie nos separará aunque te busque Al Pacino, mami

Jaja
What up, baby?

My bitch like a model
Where the genie? She shaped like a bottle

She wanna fuck off the cranberry vodka
Why that girl friend?keep?blockin', Ibaka
I'm tired?of this bitch, she get checked?like a doctor
That bitch, two models who can't wait to swallow
You waistin' my time, I hate that I came
I didn't even call, tryna put dick in your gums
You got a gut full of rum, why your ass still actin' dumb?
Oh, throw her on the block list, gone
Neck full of water like the lightnin' [?]
Flyest young nigga, no contest (Fly)
Four hundred thousand, spend it on taxes
Can't wait to show the pussy niggas what the racks is
Show 'em what the racks do, I don't do pat downs
My bitch brother stick in in the night gown
Whole lot of [?] goin' in your background
Niggas like to act now, I don't like to talk now
I been gettin' a whole lot of money, no cap
I been tryna get my big brother out the trap
But he keep goin' back

Cardo got wings
Now we cookin' up, hey
Yeah
Leave her in the past, but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 1]
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm on, so they textin' me
Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best thing
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak that was a year ago
Wanted you back so bad, but that's

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

[Bridge]
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

[Verse 2]
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

[Bridge]
I hope her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be

[Chorus]
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone (Ayy)
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone

Damn, why is she so demonic?
She Medusa with a little Pocahontas
She been lacin' all my drugs or somethin'
'Cause every time that we're together, I'm unconscious
Hold up, uh, let me be honest
I know I saw her put the Percs in my chronic
Smokin' 'til my eyes roll back like the omen
Just another funeral for her, goddamn

Take it, let you roll my weed, please don't lace it, yeah (Yeah)
That's a bum bitch that you chasin', ayy (Yeah)
Foreign with me, she a dominatrix (Woah)
I love that girl and I do like her body
""I don't want the money, I just want the molly""
That's what she say when she lived in the Valley
Lil' boy, I'm your father, hakuna matata
I made that girl give all of that top up
Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose on my chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Lil Uzi Vert]
Wasted, GTA love, bitches wasted

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?

With your narrow-minded cronies

Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good)

So no one gives you a damn

Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal? Shark!

Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.i.D)

I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song

Ooh, I know the feelin', ain't it? (Okay)
You ever feel the way I feel, you know it feel amazin' (Let's go)
I had this bitch, we used to kick it, she was feelin' Baby (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
She stepped on my heart, had me feelin' basic (Damn)
You know how people like to come back when you level up (Uh-huh)
I made a change, you stayed the same, I got ahead of ya
Plus I been tryin' to free some time up in my schedule, but (Uh-huh)
When opportunity knockin', I never say no
'Cause I been busy catchin' them blessings I used to pray for (Let's go)
Stackin' up the backend like Tetris, we playin' Legos
And every day I pray to God that a nigga don't try to play, though
'Cause I don't like to play, be done gave a nigga a halo (Boom, boom, boom)
Thinkin' 'bout the people I lost, know I got some angels
Chillin' with my freak, when we fuckin', it ease my anger
I'm takin' selfies with my bitch, she keep switchin' up different angles
And no, I never kept a bitch, but I always keep me a banger (Boom, boom, boom)

Ooh, I let her ride again
She spread her legs and open up, I end up slidin' in (Okay)
She know the shit excitin' you is not excitin' him (Me)
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin (Yup)
He know to come look where I'm at, he wanna find her, shit (She with me)
Know I'm aggressive, when she kiss me, like to bite her lip (Grr)
I don't be makin' love songs, they don't excite a jit (No)
Real nigga, I got feelings, I'm not hiding it (Yeah, okay, let's go)
Still pimpin', tell the bitch I really like her friend (Yeah, bitch)
You know her pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly her in (Yeah, bitch)
If I speak once, she don't respond, I won't say hi again (Bitch)
She catch me once and let me slide, I never lie again (Let's go)
My name not Melly, I got murder on my mind again (Uh-huh)

And if he think 'bout tryin' me, he better try again

Melon and the coconut are sittin' on the floor
Coco said to Melly, ""I can't do this anymore
Everything we're doin' just feels fuckin' cold
Everything we're shootin', that's just fake B-roll
B-sides, killing time, filler, that's all
How did things happen when we were so close?
How did this all go so Pete Tong?
When it all started, I thought we would grow old
Living in the city with a baby and a dog
Doing school runs in a four by four
I make pancakes and waffles
I could be a stay at home G.I. Joe""

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Melly said to Coco, ""You can't do this anymore
One day, you'll see you're fuckin' wrong
Sometimes B-sides are the best songs
Sometimes killing time's very fruitful
I know I can't make you younger
I can't stop life movin' onwards
I can't hide you from life's horrors
I'm not makin' you like your father
Too much quinoa and online shopping

That first kiss on your doorstep
You looked perfect
Wish I framed that moment

We talk until we're speechless
'Cause we're left without a reason to stay
And keep hurting each other this way

I hope you find that someone who'll love you
And it feels like all that you wanted
Thought it would last if we just kept running
We played our hand, now we're left with nothing
Hope you find that someone who'll hold you

A hundred shots, but we kept on missing
There's no regrets, 'cause we tried, my love

Loves you like I couldn't do

No food to eat
All the money's been wasted from last week
I can't even leave
So I sit in the basement, making up rad beats
Hot cup of tea
It's four o'clock in the middle of the night and I can't sleep
It's all on the peak
So bad I can taste it while it eats me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there

Some part of me
Feels a little bit naked and empty
I'm stuck underneath
A few dirty old blankets to comfort me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?

And I can see why I'm still alive

You think I'd be tired
Every night, I'm sick and why?
Ohh, I'm staying up this time

Know what I've been going through lately?
Sometimes I, I get depressed, I might overeat or I might not eat
Sometimes I get to buying shit that I don't even need
Clothes that I'm never gon' wear
I get to entertaining old relationships and shit

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key
They don't care about a nigga like me so I
Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I had just finished a prison stench
Without the presumption of innocence
The system don't look at me different
When I'm only trying to do something legitimate
My children been mad at they mothers
Like, ""When is our daddy coming home?""
We video visit on FaceTime but they like a thousand miles away
Christian Louboutin, I got my spikes on now
Fall off in the morning, look like Girls Gone Wild
I'm in Chiraq and you know how I'm livin'
I'm warning 'em in, it's a dangerous city
I'm still tryna see where the fuck I fit in
When all that I did was get caught with a pistol
Chief of parole was a black man
Or, in better words, another nigga
You know you lied on me on the stand
I'm still tryna see what I did
Went to trial in federal court, knowing I was gon' lose
Even when the verdict got rendered, I'll still be a bread winner

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key

Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I thought when I got out of jail in Florida
I wouldn't sit in a cell again
Broke the lil' promise I made to my daughter
That I wouldn't put her through hell again
The man in the mirror look at me and whispered
""You gotta get better control of your businesses
Quit being stubborn whenever you suffer
The people that suffer the most are your children""
Flew her in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go out
A victim of circumstance, in my section I'm labeled a shooter
People that don't even know me
So how in the fuck they controlling my future?
All of the people who matter be smilin'
I know that they proud of me
Holdin' it down up the road in the pen
Everybody that doubted me
Flew baby in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go out

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key
They don't care about a nigga like me so I
Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Til the lights go down
You know sometimes I—
I— I— I get— I get depressed, you know, and I can't move, and I—
I might get on Instagram and slide in the DM of a bitch that I used to fuck with
And I fly baby in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go down

Kevin Gates),"[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Know what I've been going through lately?
Sometimes I, I get depressed, I might overeat or I might not eat
Sometimes I get to buying shit that I don't even need
Clothes that I'm never gon' wear
I get to entertaining old relationships and shit

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key
They don't care about a nigga like me so I
Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I had just finished a prison stench
Without the presumption of innocence
The system don't look at me different
When I'm only trying to do something legitimate
My children been mad at they mothers
Like, ""When is our daddy coming home?""
We video visit on FaceTime but they like a thousand miles away
Christian Louboutin, I got my spikes on now
Fall off in the morning, look like Girls Gone Wild
I'm in Chiraq and you know how I'm livin'
I'm warning 'em in, it's a dangerous city
I'm still tryna see where the fuck I fit in
When all that I did was get caught with a pistol
Chief of parole was a black man
Or, in better words, another nigga
You know you lied on me on the stand
I'm still tryna see what I did
Went to trial in federal court, knowing I was gon' lose
Even when the verdict got rendered, I'll still be a bread winner

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key
They don't care about a nigga like me so I
Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I thought when I got out of jail in Florida
I wouldn't sit in a cell again
Broke the lil' promise I made to my daughter
That I wouldn't put her through hell again
The man in the mirror look at me and whispered
""You gotta get better control of your businesses
Quit being stubborn whenever you suffer
The people that suffer the most are your children""
Flew her in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go out
A victim of circumstance, in my section I'm labeled a shooter
People that don't even know me
So how in the fuck they controlling my future?
All of the people who matter be smilin'
I know that they proud of me
Holdin' it down up the road in the pen
Everybody that doubted me
Flew baby in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go out

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Real ones know the shoes that I walk in
Had to make it out, I had no option
Hit the cell or the block or the coffin
Had to make it out, I had no option
Lock me up, throw away the key
They don't care about a nigga like me so I
Stack it up, I got this shit poppin'
Had to make it out, I had no option (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Kevin Gates]
'Til the lights go down
You know sometimes I—
I— I— I get— I get depressed, you know, and I can't move, and I—
I might get on Instagram and slide in the DM of a bitch that I used to fuck with
And I fly baby in from Houston, got my ice on now
Lick on her lil' body 'til the lights go down
'Til the lights go down, oh

Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?

She's good for me, too good

I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, ""Why bother?""

If I'm underneath the table
Then pour me another drink

I'm a hazard to myself
On a fast track to perdition

You should confiscate my key
I will drive you up the fucking wall

But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains

[Verse 2]
I was stood there in the spotlight
With this city at my feet
But I was a dead man walking
Nothing ever comes for free

So I moved on down to London
Where I traded in my soul
I could not fill my heart
With all those one night stands and gold

So throw me out your mom's house
I've been living there too long
Well she never liked me anyway
Cause she knows I'm northern scum

So I get high, so high and I drink
I suffered enough of the heart palps when I think
Discovered it up at the bar 9 drinks in
Now I'm at the disco, convinced the girls think I'm the bizzo
Course I'm on the brink
Looking at me funny then course I'm gonna swing
Karaoke? Course I wanna sing
Or pour me another drink
It always ends the same
Or I'm a condemned prisoner

It's late as fuck, I'm thinkin' like, ""How did I get here again?""
Found myself in tears again with everythin' that I ever feared
I promised that I wouldn't lose myself, but damn it, here I am
I'm in my head constantly, and like right now, I need you right here
I'm in my bed prayin' up to the sky hopin' that God can hear
This shit ain't fair, now that I got bread, I'm 'posed to be happy, yeah
That should be cool, but nothin' is

[Chorus]
I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you

And your corner's the streets that I passed by
Your heart beats a million miles away

We'll dance like the waves on the coastline
Imagine a dream where you don't wake

Streets erased of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology, yeah

I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop (Hey)
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that'd be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
I'm in a world of pain
This cold the damn world gave to me (Woo)
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale
A warmer breath

I seen her kitty, it drown in the ocean
She fuck with the tide, I see it, I notice
She love the melody, sing with the chorus
Drip from all over, come from different sources
See how I carry it, I cannot force it
Good Off-White, Chrome Hearts on us
There was a time when I couldn't afford this
Got right to it, spun this shit like an orbit
Clippin' the navy, we ran it for twenty
Made out like bandits, we came out with plenty
It's a celebration, where is the Henny?
Stackin' a G, but we on to the next
When's the next plane? What's the next move?
When you stay winnin', no option to lose
My bitch know better, I know she don't choose
If she did, I don't care, fell in love with the loot

Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks
Saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now

All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive

To no run-of-the-mill talk jive

I remember the day I met you
You smiled after I said yes
You kissed me and I swayed
I had little, but I offered you everything
And it's hard, so many years have passed
Since I've known you and we're two strangers again
I miss your first kisses
The sex in the kitchen and in the bathroom
The nights at the movie and dinner for two
Your ""I love you's"" sound weird, even your voice has changed
I feel even like an asshole believing everything Amós would say
But it's true, it's time to say goodbye
Ayy, ayy, I don't know whose fault it is but that's not even the point
Give me back my heart even if it's in pieces
Ayy, 'cause I'll stick them step by step
But let me go already, 'cause I'm falling behind
For your own good, for my own good (Oh)
You know that this love ends in a mess (Oh)
If I see you with another guy I'll smile to you (Oh)
Why should we hate each other after what we've lived? (Oh)

One spends time with others, one enjoys, one loves and wants

I don't make songs, I make anthems so that they don't expire (Ayy)
In this genre, I was a hadouken (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

I fucked all of my crushes, shh, I'm getting bored of fucking too (Eyy, rra)
And I'm a milly without using Richard (Ayy)

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it’s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need, ayy (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

[Chorus]
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

[Chorus]
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""

Fingers and thumbs, baby

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

[Chorus]
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""

It's just the way that they made me
Son, I behave like an animal, I'm a savage
I be goin' beast mode, doin' damage
I'm on demon time, I'm never average
I'm goin' up until I'm mad, mad, mad rich
I'm savage mode, I'm not average
I'm on demon time, just in my cabbage
I gotta get it though, ain't nothin' average
Fuckin' burn it all up until I'm mad, mad, mad rich

[Verse]
I been overthinkin' lots of things
Please don't try to quote me, every word that I say
I've been busy, focused on my rings
Not a lot of sleep in my oversized bed
I like who I am, why would I change?
Lit for the moment, darling, never pipe down
Turn up on 'em even in the rain
Highlights, baby, it's a wild life now, until I lie down
Passport picture, tell a story
Where I'm from, nah, I ain't never go back
Skin too smooth, teeth too straight
Real hood nigga, never knew that
Tryna move smooth, wanna move right
Save a little bit 'cause it don't last
Goin' in circles in this life, you gon' realize ain't no slow dance
(Roses)
Nigga got his roses while he livin'
I'm gon' give this Porsche to my children
Neck full of water so he drippin'
Michael never met his Scottie Pippen

It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

We started in October
Drowned our sins in cold November rain
Thoughts all through December
Prayed for snow to cover up the pain
Been so long under winter's night
Waiting for the sun
Watching the horizon

Everybody's coming home for summer
But still feels a thousand miles away
What a feeling, taste the freedom
There with every bite
Finally we're coming home

We shadow-boxed the enemy
Swing until we extradite our fears
Their backed into a corner
Ring the bell, we shed our blood and tears
Like hibernating sun-rays, hoping for the sun
Watching the horizon

Everybody's coming home for summer
But still feels a thousand miles away
What a feeling, taste the freedom
There with every bite
Finally we're coming home

Oh, we suffered in silence
Through storms and through violence
We've stayed our way
The waves have sub-sided
The clouds have divided
Found a reason to survive
Found the will to stay alive

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

They switching sides, them niggas ain't ridin'
Them niggas ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They know it ain't tomorrow
They really actin' like time really ain't borrowed
I know the sorrows
They switching sides, them niggas wasn't ridin' with you
They ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They actin' like they know you, the things you go through
And they was never for you

[Verse 1]
Who do I blame? Balancin' the pain
Valentino frames, heart full of rage
Hard to crack a smile when the scars still remain
Toast in the air for the ones who ain't changed
Dope dealer drained, Porsche in the rain
Nights on the train, squad screamin' ""Gang""
'Member watchin' Menace, really in the screen
Mama workin' double, I can still feel the strain
Don't keep a main, hoes be betrayin'
Lost to the fame, cross in the flame
Daps and the smiles fake, it don't feel the same
I come from the gutter, so I'm strapped and I'm prayin'

They actin' like they know you, the things you go through
And they was never for you

Who do I blame? Look who I became
Roc-A-Fella chain, try not to be ashamed
Of the friendships that you lose
When you're at your lowest time, you will confuse
Pray for better news, chasin' avenues
You been grounded enough, you comin' up, you from the bottom
Long nights, just to spite 'em, I don't put the top on
Better things, slander names, really tryna block 'em
All of that 'cause they're insecure to be forgotten
I'm comin' down on here
It's gettin' cold down here
We gettin' snow down here
Can't slow down here
It's gettin' low down here
They lettin' blood out here
Click-clack, unload, reload, load out here
Done with the lies, I'm done with the lies
I'm seein' right through in they eyes, yeah, yeah
Tell 'em goodbyes, I'm yellin' goodbyes
I'm seein' right now in their vibe they hate
Two of my brothers, we used to be close
And now we ain't speakin' so much these days
Clear to me nobody's perfect, not on the surface
I hate to be one day late
Corner niggas switching for the linemen
Private school niggas flyin' private
They don't even stop when I'm arrivin'
Can still feel the hate when I close my eyelids

They switching sides, them niggas ain't ridin'
Them niggas ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They not here tomorrow

Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you

[Verse 1: Randy Nota Loca, Maluma]
I know that you'll use me if I get close (Auh)
Because you're hot
You only call me so I give you the vein
The guy isn't eating up the girl
Now I'm who goes with her (Yeah)
Ask, see what happens, the boyfriend is a joke
Don't let anyone know that you're in my house
You're a bandit, you call me so I put it in-in—
You make me give it to you-you
I am double ho-ho—, horny, yes (Woo)
If you don't believe me-me
Horny with me, what do you think-think? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Maluma]
The girl has me happy and she's a fan of my skinny body
Even though she's on diet, she's been eating it for a while
And like Yaviah what she wants is contact, but without a contract
Her guy doesn't give it to her-her, in intimacy-cy
That's why she looks for me to plan the escape
I get magnetic, energetic, romantic
And like Zion, I remember the ""Zundada""

You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex

You use me saying that he's your ex

I will give it to her, give it to her, give it to her (Haha)
On DM she hits me up, she tells me she's alone, mami

[Verse 3: Zion]
Whenever she calls, she knows I'm going (Uh)
Impossible to deny giving it to her
Sometimes I think you want to use me
Abuse, but I'm going to let myself
She leaves her boyfriend and she gets loose like never before
She alone poisons me and I like it
She's hot, and she lights it and enjoys
Make love to each other she says that karma doesn't scare her
Who sees her? She texts me
She treats me well when her boyfriend fights with her
She doesn't care if they see us
We always kill it wherever, eh-ah

Baby
Yeah, yeah
Haha
There you'll see me with him
Maybe (Prra)
Aah
Rudeboyz

[Chorus: Maluma, Zion, Maluma & Zion]
I don't know why, baby (I don't know)
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex
I already got tired, yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah, eh)
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex (Zion)

[Post-Chorus: Zion]
And I go, go, go (Ooh-ooh)
Today I'm going out to the street in search of that girl
I will give it to her, give it to her, give it to her (Woah, oh)
On DM she hits me up, she tells me she's alone, mami

[Verse 1: Randy Nota Loca, Maluma]
I know that you'll use me if I get close (Auh)
Because you're hot
You only call me so I give you the vein
The guy isn't eating up the girl
Now I'm who goes with her (Yeah)
Ask, see what happens, the boyfriend is a joke
Don't let anyone know that you're in my house
You're a bandit, you call me so I put it in-in—
You make me give it to you-you
I am double ho-ho—, horny, yes (Woo)
If you don't believe me-me
Horny with me, what do you think-think? (Yeah)
She likes that I give it to her (Give)

[Chorus: Maluma]
I don't know why, baby (I don't know)
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex
I already got tired, yeah-yeah-yeah
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex

Today I'm going out to the street in search of that girl
I will give it to her, give it to her, give it to her (Woah, oh)
On DM she hits me up, she tells me she's alone, mami

[Verse 2: Maluma]
The girl has me happy and she's a fan of my skinny body
Even though she's on diet, she's been eating it for a while
And like Yaviah what she wants is contact, but without a contract
Her guy doesn't give it to her-her, in intimacy-cy
That's why she looks for me to plan the escape
I get magnetic, energetic, romantic
And like Zion, I remember the ""Zundada""

[Chorus: Randy Nota Loca]
I don't know why, baby (Why?)
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex
I already got tired, yeah-yeah-yeah
You only call me when you are hot
And you grind with him, maybe
You use me saying that he's your ex

And I go, go, go
Today I'm going out to the street in search of that girl
I will give it to her, give it to her, give it to her (Haha)
On DM she hits me up, she tells me she's alone, mami

[Verse 3: Zion]
Whenever she calls, she knows I'm going (Uh)
Impossible to deny giving it to her
Sometimes I think you want to use me
Abuse, but I'm going to let myself
She leaves her boyfriend and she gets loose like never before
She alone poisons me and I like it
She's hot, and she lights it and enjoys
Make love to each other she says that karma doesn't scare her
Who sees her? She texts me
She treats me well when her boyfriend fights with her
She doesn't care if they see us
We always kill it wherever, eh-ah

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse

Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down

One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin

Afraid to be alone again, I hate this

But they never cry out loud, cry out

Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale

But if it happens again, I know what would be your weakness

Because last night was (-ht)
Something that I can't explain
Alone, giving it and giving it without stopping (-ing)
You told me you'd die for me

Something that I can't explain (Eh-eh)
That was giving it and giving it without stopping
You on top of me, me on top of you (Oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny, ROSALÍA]
You left my body hot, hell
But you left my heart cold, winter
Dreaming I'm with you is when I sleep (I Sleep)
Tell me, papi
Tell me, mami
Who is erasing that night?
You kissed me and my hat fell off
Without lots of sweet-talk, without lots of sweet-talk
When I'm with you I let the vibe go
And let the moon supervise us
With that sweet mouth, everything you tell me is delicious
We did positions that I, mami, I never did
You got wet so that I'd baptize myself
And that I'd get serious, serious
You and I together creating an empire
Those eyes have a mystery
But in the end, nothing of ours was serious

[Pre-Chorus: Bad Bunny]
And it's already happened to me, that they've given me hope
And it's already happened to me, that they've abandoned me
And it's already happened to me, that you're not at my side

'Cause I'd go to Japan again (Hey)
Papi, what a pain you are, what a curse (Mmm)
The palet is sweet, sugar from cotton (Yeah)
And it's the only one that reaches my heart
I am not forgetting the clear certainty (Boom)
My hair got tangled in the earrings
You know that I only do it of legend status (Woo!)
I raise it to the ceiling, I'm his Messiah
Benito is a little devil and an angel
I have them hooked as if it were a tate
Baby, we never compete with each other
If they ask, he says: ""She breaks all the records""

2 AM, howlin' outside
Lookin', but I cannot find
Don't you fall asleep this time
I been on a long way drive
Only you can stand my mind
Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Okay, I got it, copy
20/20 but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies (Yeah)
No, that wasn't my girl, that was just a hobby (Yeah, yeah)
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me, yeah, yeah
X-ray vision, see through you niggas
Newspaper stand, we press the issue (Press it, press it, press the issue)
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles (Yeah, right up at your hood up north)
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I've been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat (Back seat, back seat, back seat, back seat)
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet (Track meet, track meet, track meet, track meet)
Gotta watch my back now, 'cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on ya

[Bridge: Travis Scott & André 3000]
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Eh-hey)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
To them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter (Hahaha)
I guess it's all survival but please be careful, uh
I gave up on the Bible long time ago, uh
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know, ha
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids, hmm
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live (Ayy)
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around (Uh, uh)
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza, uh
And said he had a label recruitin' people (Uh)
Put that on my grandma and everything, yeah
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
But what a memory, it may need interludes (Could've been me)
What's gon' patch up my inner tube
So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

[Outro: Travis Scott]

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
(Oh-ooh) No
(Ooh) No, no, no
(Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)

I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

Is there a 12 step just for you?

Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

Future
(Future nostalgia)
(Future nostalgia)
(Future nostalgia)

[Verse 1]
You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game
Like modern architecture, John Lautner coming your way
I know you like this beat 'cause Jeff's been doin' the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name (Future nostalgia)

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)

[Verse 2]
Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house (Future nostalgia)
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face (Future nostalgia)
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

[Post-Chorus]
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)

[Bridge]
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants (Haha)

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future)
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

[Verse 1: Ñengo Flow]
Real G4 Life, baby
Tell me what you want, my girl, decide
If you taste me you'll get attached, lose control
You know what's going to happen here
The smoke from the weed is already making you bad
We go on a trip and we don't want to land
Mami, let's go into the darkness
To keep getting horny
Your body is shaking
Come here, I wanna heat it up
I made you wet your panties
Inside her body I always keep it

Calm down, 'cause you're very comfortable, let's go in my Rrari
Call your one friend, the one you call ""shorty""
Tell her I won't give you back until she gets lonely (Breathe, ah)
For now dance with me on that Tony, my honey, I see you're lonely
You're my Elvi and I'm your Tony Montana
Let's do it 'til the morning
I'll do you hard until we break the whole bed, ah

I swear I won't respond
Ay, baby, I want contact

[Verse 3: Jory Boy]
But tell her I come from the island, I won't lie to you (Shake it out)
From the entertainment
It's not unknown to anyone
That you and I get hot without it being anything serious
But I get active and I go right away (Yeah)
Where I go I kill her at night like a hunter
Lighting with Maluma in the Aventador
Medallo with a Puerto Rican is devastating
But tell me, let's see, if you're horny, ah-ah
With you I get horny
You're the audience and I'm the theater (Yaw)
Come here, 'cause I'll just call for a little while

Everybody knows me
Everybody holds a piece of truth
Everybody sees me
They all have a point of view
But no one really knows me like you
Nobody would see it
And I can feel the doubts creep in my mind
You kept me believing
Told me it's alright, just give it time
Nobody knows me like you

[Pre-Chorus]
When my world's on fire
You kill the flames
I love how you're always
The beauty in my pain

[Chorus]
Most hearts never stay
But your love keeps me safe
People come and people go
But you and I, we're beautiful
So let the whole world change
We'll stay the same

[Verse 2]
There's something that we're made of
It's greater than the distance we're apart
I don't need to say much
'Cause you can read me right from where you are
No one really knows me like you

When my world's on fire
You kill the flames
I love how you're always
The beauty in my pain

But you and I, we're beautiful
So let the whole world change
We'll stay the same

Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

[Chorus]
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

[Verse 1]
Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me

She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

She like when I tell her to spit on it (Like, psh)
I get that mouth and I sit on the couch and I make her sit on it (Let's go)
Yeah, I was that lil' nigga that could take a bitch from his big homie
Especially if she flexible, I flex her
I take both her legs and I put 'em behind her head like she a pretzel
Then I pick her up and I slam her down on her head like I'm a wrestler
Like mm, tryna kill the pussy, call the ambulance, get a stretcher
I be fucking his bitch while he ain't at home
And she got them pics of me in her phone

And I ain't trippin' when a nigga pull my hair, 'cause he gon' pay for it to put it back in

Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up

Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket

Diamonds aquatic, it feel like a trout on my wrist (Wrist)
Or a spout on my wrist with a spider up in it (In it)
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it, I'm on it, I'm in it
If you try to take it, the clip get extended
I'm back on my bullshit, like Jordan on Pippen

Everybody knows me
Everybody holds a piece of truth
Everybody sees me
They all have a point of view
But no one really knows me like you
Nobody would see it
And I can feel the doubts creep in my mind
You kept me believing
Told me it's alright, just give it time
Nobody knows me like you

[Pre-Chorus]
When my world's on fire
You kill the flames
I love how you're always
The beauty in my pain

[Chorus]
Most hearts never stay
But your love keeps me safe
People come and people go
But you and I, we're beautiful
So let the whole world change
We'll stay the same

There's something that we're made of
It's greater than the distance we're apart
I don't need to say much
'Cause you can read me right from where you are
No one really knows me like you

When my world's on fire
You kill the flames
I love how you're always
The beauty in my pain

Most hearts never stay
But your love keeps me safe

But you and I, we're beautiful
So let the whole world change
We'll stay the same

'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

From the man I belong to

When he takes me in his arms
He whispers to me
I see life in pink
He tell me love words
Everyday words
And it does something to me

He has entered in my heart
A slice of happiness
That I know the reason
It's him for me, me for him in life
He told me, swore it for life

And as soon as I see him
So I feel Inside me

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick

Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me

Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee

Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga

I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

[Verse 2]
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away

Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)

Born from a different mind, when you see me, you toast me, oh

Just play my mama this if I die right now
Before I close my eyes, before I lie down
Whenever I hang my hat, I'll never hide my crown
And the views got a nigga distracted
Porsche on the hill lookin' pretty attractive
And I'll use her, I'ma do it, you can't tell her your tactics

And Meek tryna lower the maxes
Trump in the House tryna lower the accents

I'm just tryna move forward, they keep pullin' me backwards

Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now

When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt

You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old, holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars

You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned

I picture you when we first met
That first kiss on your doorstep
You looked perfect
Wish I framed that moment
I sit here waiting for your footsteps
Heartbeat's fast, I know there's no way back
We talk until we're speechless
'Cause we're left without a reason to stay
And keep hurting each other this way

[Chorus]
I hope you find that someone who'll love you
And it feels like all that you wanted
Thought it would last if we just kept running
We played our hand, now we're left with nothing
Hope you find that someone who'll hold you
In a way that I always wanted to
A hundred shots, but we kept on missing
There's no regrets, 'cause we tried, my love
I hope you find that someone who
Loves you like I couldn't do

Nights so hard 'cause I can't forget
You in that moment
And I know it's stupid to call

I'm thinking they'll know just about everything
I bet they planned it all out like the shows
Went everywhere I go
Walked in the store right behind me
Stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home
I'm sure they figured it out, early on
That I would never run
That they could shoot but that's no fun
'Cause then they're killing the stolen son

[Chorus]
Oh, anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please
Anything, anything
Don't tell them anything
Anything, please
Anything, anything (We're going to die, die, down, die, die)
Don't tell them anything (We're going to die, die, down, die, die)
Anything, please
Anything, anything (We're going to die, die, down, die, die)
Don't tell them anything (We're going to die, die, down, die, die)
Anything, please, oh

[Outro]
We're going to die, die, down, die, die, down
We're going to die, die, down, die
We're going to die, die, down, die, die, down
We're going to die, die, down, die

When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go (Yeah, yeah)
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close (Yeah)
Should have known you were lonely

I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love

So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again

You always miss the chance to fall for someone else (Uh, uh)
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left (Uh)
They just made you feel lonely (Hey)

I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart

Now you wanna come back
But that's not possible
Rudeboyz
Yo

[Pre-Chorus: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (You, you)
Now you want to come back
Now I don't feel anything, I'm not for you anymore (For you; woo)
Where you came from, to right there you're going to return yourself (Yeah, yeah)
The karma stole your peace, that doesn't rest (Rest)
Our thing is from yesterday's newspaper

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

[Verse 1: Ñejo]
And if you see me walking over there
Tell her that I'm already happy
That I put it in someone else
That I forgot about you, that I don't love you anymore
It's true that I had to go for a couple of days to the brothel
And if you knew with it was that I forgot you
She was ugly, kinda chubby, but that isn't seen when she's on all fours
I remember when I saw you in the Lleras, I moved to another the sidewalk
Thank God I wouldn't cum inside you
'Cause I can't deny you're really hot
But I got tired of you always perceiving me as stupid (As stupid)
For all I care, let everything go to Hell (To Hell)
It was you who decided to throw it all in the trash

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

[Verse 2: Dálmata]
Cupid missed the shot
I almost got engaged, but no
I almost said ""I love you"", I almost got married
And even though that wasn't the case
I almost even impregnated you, almost
I almost impregnated you
Wanting to feel you up, I almost ended up putting my whole arm inside
I almost said ""I love you"", I almost got married
But that didn't happen, Valentine's Day never arrived
Everything ended up being a failure
Cupid missed the shot
Ours wasn't love
Ours wasn't poetry, it was a fantasy love
Pure habit and obsession
That day after day it made us
To think that there was a strong bond that brought us together
Ours wasn't love (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ñejo]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you (Bastard, bastard)

[Verse 3: Maluma]
And now it turns out
I'm at fault for our problems
Two months ago you were asking for forgiveness
And I don't get how now you're asking me if I want to get back with you

[Pre-Chorus: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (You, you)
Now you want to come back
Now I don't feel anything, I'm not for you anymore (For you; woo)
Where you came from, to right there you're going to return yourself (Yeah, yeah)
The karma stole your peace, that doesn't rest (Rest)
Our relationship is yesterday's newspaper (Yo')

Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

Now you wanna come back
But that's not possible
Rudeboyz
Yo

[Pre-Chorus: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (You, you)
Now you want to come back
Now I don't feel anything, I'm not for you anymore (For you; woo)
Where you came from, to right there you're going to return yourself (Yeah, yeah)
The karma stole your peace, that doesn't rest (Rest)
Our thing is from yesterday's newspaper

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

[Verse 1: Ñejo]
And if you see me walking over there
Tell her that I'm already happy
That I put it in someone else
That I forgot about you, that I don't love you anymore
It's true that I had to go for a couple of days to the brothel
And if you knew with it was that I forgot you
She was ugly, kinda chubby, but that isn't seen when she's on all fours
I remember when I saw you in the Lleras, I moved to another the sidewalk
Thank God I wouldn't cum inside you
'Cause I can't deny you're really hot
But I got tired of you always perceiving me as stupid (As stupid)
For all I care, let everything go to Hell (To Hell)
It was you who decided to throw it all in the trash

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

[Verse 2: Dálmata]
Cupid missed the shot
I almost got engaged, but no
I almost said ""I love you"", I almost got married
And even though that wasn't the case
I almost even impregnated you, almost
I almost impregnated you
Wanting to feel you up, I almost ended up putting my whole arm inside
I almost said ""I love you"", I almost got married
But that didn't happen, Valentine's Day never arrived
Everything ended up being a failure
Cupid missed the shot
Ours wasn't love
Ours wasn't poetry, it was a fantasy love
Pure habit and obsession
That day after day it made us
To think that there was a strong bond that brought us together
Ours wasn't love (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ñejo]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you
But please go away, go away, go away
We're like water and oil
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you (Bastard, bastard)

[Verse 3: Maluma]
And now it turns out
I'm at fault for our problems
Two months ago you were asking for forgiveness
And I don't get how now you're asking me if I want to get back with you

[Pre-Chorus: Maluma]
They say I changed, but I changed for you (You, you)
Now you want to come back
Now I don't feel anything, I'm not for you anymore (For you; woo)
Where you came from, to right there you're going to return yourself (Yeah, yeah)
The karma stole your peace, that doesn't rest (Rest)
Our relationship is yesterday's newspaper (Yo')

[Chorus: Maluma]
Go away, go away, go away
You'll take my bad luck with you
Now I'm better, better without you
I feel fucking amazing, fucking amazing without you

[Outro: Ñejo, Maluma, Dálmata]
I've spoken to Papi Juancho
If he would let me be in the album
Let me do it, even if it's a hook
Let's see if I buy a mansion

Music from the street
From Medellín to the whole planet
So that they know how it is
I come from the front with all the power

From Medellín to the whole planet
So that they know how it is
I come from the front with all the power

[Verse 1]
I'm chilling at the house
Making music, well that's my purpose
I'm not pausing it
The crazies listen to it, the police enjoy it
It's going on livestream, real cool and ready
It's already done, the patch is already armed
For those who are in the hood and in the park
In the sack, getting over a hangover
And for those who like to take it to the head
I deal with them on the phone from the apartment (You're hot)
If they want to chat, I'll chat
For the kid who leaves drunk with wine
To see Medellín from El Picacho
The people know it and the people know it
'Cause with this album I scored a goal
Like someone positive, like a beast
From Medallo City to planet Earth

[Chorus]
Music from the street
From Medellín to the whole planet
So that they know how it is
I come from the front with all the power
Music from the street
From Medellín to the whole planet
So that they know how it is
I come from the front with all the power

[Verse 2]
With all the power, with all the money
With all the beats and with all my dawgs
With all the salsas, with all the cheeses
With all the meats and the seasonings
That's the recipe that's cooked
For the whole planet from the corner
For the people in the hoods and in the center
Here I bring it to them so that they enjoy it (So that they enjoy it)
And so that they so relax to this flow
I offer you this melody that's good
I dreamed it I hope it doesn't fail
To speak to the world from Medallo and its streets
I'm telling you about my city
I'll take you from the north to the south and on the graffiti tour
Expressing myself with the local slang
I represent Medallo on a global level

[Chorus]
Music from the street (Oh, no)
From Medellín to the whole planet (Medallo, dude)
Music in Medallo, dude (Oh, no, oh, no)
With all the power
Music from the street (From the street)
From Medellín to the whole planet (Medallo, baby)
'Cause Medallo isn't Pablo Escobar
There's a better story to tell

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house
There's some whores in this house (Hol' up)
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

[Verse 1: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)

They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting

Are you on your way?
Are you coming soon to me?
No parking in LA
So I'ma send a Uber to your place
Is my secret safe?
Safe with just you and me
We can't leave a trace
This is my favorite mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Look in my eyes
Can you find the lies? Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
Do you mind the lies? Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes

[Chorus]
We both know it's wrong
But you're still coming over
Even when you're gone
The feeling just grow stronger
Should leave it alone
But you're still getting closer
We both know it's wrong
Can't keep this for long
While it's going on
I'll put it in a song

[Verse 2]
Are you on your way?
Are you coming soon to me?
I'm getting impatient
Look at what you do to me
Our secret's safe so you're my favorite mistake
That's why we gotta keep it on the low (Low)
Girl at home but she don't need to know (Know)
What's going on, it won't be on for long, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Look in my eyes
Can you find the lies?
Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
Do you mind the lies?
Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes

We both know it's wrong
But you're still coming over
Even when you're gone

Should leave it alone

I didn't want to accept it, no (No, no)
But the Earth and you have something in common (In common)
You dragged me around the floor
Although I didn't believe you could hurt me
You didn't water the roses that I gave you
They dried, they look like you
My blue sky you turned it gray
I hope they don't do to you what you did to me

Because I'm going to enjoy myself
I'll fuck chicks that are better than you
One that loves me and is loyal to me
Not like you, you're worthless, you only knew to turn
I let you out and now, baby, give me a railing
You are two colors, like a Panda

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)

Packed up the photo album Matthew had made

Poured the old ginger beer down the sink

But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case

You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you

What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)

Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Uh, it looks like I lost something
I relieve my anxiety with a sip of coffee
An endless rest
Happiness suddenly comes towards me uncomfortably
24 hours, that’s plenty of time
I could sleep all day but there’s still no problem
I think I should work till my body breaks
I’m the damn guy who eats three meals a day
My crime, the dog bit me while I was resting
Scream “Don’t do that,” but I’m depending on results every day
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail
Keep growling, tap a rotten rope
Insecurity, this is a disease
The physical stuff is a stun from work, ow!

I'm sick, yeah, because I think too much
I hate that
I’m childish but not that simple

Even our hearts need a vacation
Oh, just do your job like it's one
I'm ill, yeah, I'm the job itself

How much do you have to earn to be happy?
This glass bottle hits your head
Is the world sick or am I sick? I’m confused
I take off my glasses, but the dark doesn't blur
Whatever label is attached to me after this time
I hope they’ll all be you
Your you, you

[Verse 3: SUGA]
Everyone has a lot of diseases, what I’m confused
Is that mankind is inherently evil
There more than 400 kinds of mental diseases
But no one really fits into any of these categories
Yo, is the world sick or am I sick?
Or do we just interpret things differently?
Or is that all to it?
I don’t know, changing myself is faster
Than looking at people differently

Laying in the silence
Waiting for the sirens

I don't wanna lose it
But I'm not getting through this
Hey, should I pray
Should I pray, yeah, to myself
To a God? To a saviour who can

Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless

Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions now

Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out

Underneath our bad blood
We've still got a sad song
Home, still a home, still a home here
It's not too late to build it back
'Cause a one in a million chance
Is still a chance, still a chance
And I would take those odds

Come fuckin' with me, better find a ditch
And throw yourself in it 'cause that's how I'm living

How you gon' live your whole life on the road
And taught not to feel any road rage?

I had to get it my own way
I used to work at the Hilton

And fallin' in love in the hallway
From where you can tell how hungry he is by if he gon' do it in broad day

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all

Let me tell you a story about a boy and a girl
It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn

[Verse 2]
And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story

[Verse 3]
Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Okay

[Bridge]
And the movie's always runnin' in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end

[Chorus]
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet

Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man

This puppy love is out of line
One more slide
And then we're back to real life

You talk like a man and taste like the sun
Ooh, and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then, I knew it was done

Now that I know that part of you's at home with him

Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away
Broad daylight
But we're sunflowers in the rain

My mama said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand, they're slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just 'cause we started this with zero innocence?
I just can't build on something that begins like this
It's a blood diamond, flawless but for that one thing

The girl is top, she gets all the drops
Small and dangerous like a Glock
She almost doesn't upload stories, far less TikToks
I'm a fan of her, I'm on top of everything
Of all of her movements
Seeing that ass is an event
Come, fuck up my feelings
And I'll buy you an apartment
Come with me in the Ferrari 'cause I have an extra seat
You're going to be mine, I have a feeling
Even though behind she has to have two hundred
I'm going to throw you a thousand five-hundred
Tell me, bae

[Chorus: ABRA]
Sorry, papi
I'm not your mami
Yo, I do whatever I want
And I also have mine in the wallet
Sorry, papi
I'm not your mami
Yo, I do whatever I want
And I also have mine in the wallet

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Nah, how could it be?
Tell me what I have to do
It's going to dawn right now
I'll give you even the password to my phone
I want to eat you like a Cell
What's your name?
We can get to know each other
I promise, it'll be a pleasure
They made your eyes with a brush
Another one like you won't be born again
That ass is an art exhibition
If you want I'll pay a subscription
Goddess, that's your definition
I want you fully and the blessing
Unique, she doesn't have a twin
You deserve to walk on a walkway
She smokes and her eyes get like ruby
I want to give you a goal and let the vuvuzelas sound
Some think that she's from Venezuela
But she's from PR, the fire's over there
Mami, you're my saint, I'll light candles for you
Waiting for you to love me

[Chorus: ABRA]
So-So-Sorry, papi
I'm not your mami
Yo, I do whatever I want
And I also have mine in the wallet
Sorry, papi
I'm not your mami
Yo, I do whatever I want
And I also have mine in the wallet

And he keeps wearing fake Supreme (Haha)

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Now that I'm not the hand that you hold

Cause I'll worry about you the whole night

Baby, come find me

But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

What desires to see each other
Feel good inside, know your talent
We're going to get to know each other (Oh, yeah)
By the looks of it, you're my entertainment

And I already know why you leave and come back
He left you hot, he doesn't solve it for you
Sick, let them find the cure
Crazy for an affair

[Chorus]
But baby, don't leave-ve'-ve'-ve'
It's that we're barely getting hot
If my instincts didn't fail me
All of your clothes are getting in the way
I don't leave your head
Your dude doesn't manage my skill, no (Woo)
But before you leave-ve'-ve'-ve'
Give me the green, baby, to make love to you

[Verse 1]
Those red panties, yeah
Immediately, I make them wet (Wet, wet, wet)
Get dressed and I'll pick you up (Up)
I'll never be second, leave the other guy deep in water
Like that don't be the main one (Oh)
I only call you to fuck
I don't have time to fight (No-oh-oh)
Then I'll have international bootys
And no one compares, she doesn't have rivals

Te dejó calienta, él no te resuelve
Enferma, que encuentren la cura loca por la aventura (Ah-ah)

But before you leave-ve'-ve'-ve' (No, no, no)
Give me the green, baby, to make love to you

But what skill, what beauty
If she puts large hands on me under the table
She sends thousands of emojis (Emojis), selfies in the room (Yeah)
I love to see her kneeling and she isn't praying
Beautiful figure, you raise my temperature
If I make love to you, I'll eat you like sushi tempura
Let's see, how long do you last? You're pure hot
Let's go to war, baby, without armor

I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me

Out of focus, didn't take a second to notice
Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

[Chorus]
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryin' to find
Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

[Verse 2]
All the streetlights illuminate what home used to feel like
And when I get to thinkin', can't sleep at night
No, I don't feel right

Make your heart unsteady
Then it breaks, so I'm prayin' that you're feelin' the same

Somethin' to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?
Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from fallin' apart
Do you ever feel like goin' back to the start?

[Bridge]
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

But you never seem to stick around
How could you let somethin' so good
Go to waste and bleed the colours out?

You must be so hard to please

Thank you for all of the pain""

You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will be criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somebody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well, you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90

(Last night, all I think about is you)

(Don't want, baby, think about you)

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
""I see no day,"" I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Summoned by your own hand

Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

Running for to come out of the rain

Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Her friends tryna find out how (I, I)
How she let a perfect nigga like me go (I know)
And everywhere she go, my song on the radio, huh?
She probably turned it down, don't wanna play me though, huh? (I know)
But I ain't really trippin', how you did me, it was fucked up (Yeah)
But when you get your mind right (Yeah), I'm waitin' on ya (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I know my old bitch miss me
(I miss you too, I can't even cap, like for real)
Now I'm gone, and my heart's empty (Wait a minute, who are you?)
I'm fucked up 'bout you (Ayo, K.i.D)
(Let me switch it up real quick, let me switch it)
Tell me what I did to you, thought I could be real with you (I know)
Let's go get a crib, I can live with you, have some kids with you (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, I'm back on my pimpin' (Pimp)
Back fuckin' four or five women
If I really did you wrong
Then tell me why the fuck I'm in my feelings
Singin' in my motherfuckin' song (Ooh-ooh)
Starin' at my motherfuckin' phone (Brrt)
Can't wait for you to pop up
Tried to get you pregnant, get you knocked up (Ooh-ooh)
You know I got the whole world against me
I thought that you was with me
Everybody out here wanna see me locked up (Ooh-ooh)
You know I love the way you do it to me, baby
Know you thinkin' 'bout when you was with DaBaby (Ooh-ooh)
Probably end up with a sucka nigga who ain't really real
A nigga who won't care about his kids
A bitch nigga, probably don't respect his mother
You know I ever catch you with a nigga, gettin' beat up
You know when you was cold, I came through and helped you heat up
What you doin' with that nigga?
Girl, you know you don't belong with him
Supposed to be with me out on the ocean with ya feet up, rollin' weed up
Keep it real with him, you ain't gotta lie

(I miss you too, I can't even cap, really)
I know, now I'm gone (I'm gone) and my heart's empty

I know (I know) my old bitch miss me
(I miss you too, I can't even cap, like for real)
Now I'm gone (I'm gone), and my heart's empty

Fuck that, I'm goin' back in, nigga
Hit it from the back end, nigga
Why you talkin' so aggressive? (Ooh-ooh)
You ever got your heart broke, nigga?
By a Spanish bitch, Narcos, nigga? (Ooh-ooh)
Got me lookin' for a Polo
Can you hear her sayin' ""Marco"", nigga?
I can't hear her sayin' ""Marco"" either (Ooh-ooh)
That mean she ain't there
That mean the lil' bitch don't care
I'm like Q when he lost Moesha
Got me feelin' like Monique when she lost the Professor
Got me feelin' like the Prince if he lost Cinderella
Fuck a glass slipper
That's her new nigga right there
Who, him? He a sucka ass nigga
Oh, so now you don't know me, wanna act like my sister
You ever seen a nigga get slapped with a pistol?
And I ain't ever goin' out sad 'bout a ho (Ooh-ooh)
But this one ain't no ho, it's my ho, nigga
So tell 'em how you feel, baby

From a...

[Verse 1]
I'm from a little city with expensive taste
Where the cars don't run till the engine breaks
Wasn't spending pennies on massive things
But invested in mess with this recipe
Couldn't quite see what the future held
And as days went by, it would tell itself
Let it struggle just a little bit more
Let it struggle just a little bit more

[Chorus]
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go

[Verse 2]
Shouldn't try to fix it if it keeps getting better
Just let it go, forget it for ever and ever and ever
Don't ever resent a letter inside a single word written
A little change can pave lanes with the right vision
Couldn't tell what would happen next
But as weeks went by, look what turned to best
Let it struggle just a little bit more
Let it struggle just a little bit more

[Chorus]
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go

[Bridge]
If what they said was all pretend, then it'd be different
If it depended on if anyone was listening
And I was listening
And when they said that what I wanted was a figment
I had to turn the other cheek, but I was listening
Yeah I was listening, listening to all

[Chorus]
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go
Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
When it's said and done
Let it go

Remember what the people said
Remember what the people said
I wasn't listening
I wasn't listening, listening at all

I've said a thousand things before
I've fallen in and out of love
I couldn't walk but tried to run

Always second-guess before I jump
I gave my all, but not enough
And with the weight of expectation, I'll be sleeping rough

And I ain't trying to be lonely, solely
But everything I touch turns to stone
Maybe I'm better off on my own

I've heard some other voices in my head

We can't live 'em if we stay the same
And I can't do this for another day

She wore white that day
Her hair up, the most beautiful she ever felt
She gave her heart that day
You promised it'd be safe in your arms
And you'll never let it go to waste
With everyone she loved by the water
She wore white that day
She was your everything
First sight from the moment on the summer night
But she couldn't stay
So you planned out all your life in your letters
Up until that winter's day
You took a plane so you would be together
She was your everything

Think twice about everything before you go
Can you remind yourself?

Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead

I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would

Nobody speaks to God these days

Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel

You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you?show?up at my?home, all alone
With a shovel and?a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause

[Pre-Chorus]
People like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash

Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?

Wrecked your car, called me cryin' in the dark
Now you're breakin' my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well

Here you got extra quality, ma
I'm going to give you, give you
An early present even if it's not Christmas-as
I know you pay for your mistakes
But come back, don't be mean
I drank a sea of Hennessy
I loved you dearly
There's not another booty that gives me, baby, ecstasy
Please, give me the yes, that everything was a dream (Uh)
That nothing happened and I never fucked her

I DMed one, ten, fifteen babies
But they're not worth it, ah
Because none is like you, none is like you

Leaving the motel, it was daylight
""Take off my clothes"" she'd tell me
Let's change the position, we feel the friction
A booty like yours can't be forgotten
But if you come back, I'll treat you nicely (Ah-ah)
I haven't seen anyone like you
You're in my head, you finish my puzzle
You drive me crazy when you kiss me

Why would you tell me that it's fate

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes

Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So, so, so unusual
You taste like surfing videos

I'm going to read your mind
Big dicks and big ol' titties on the sly
Say I got Aries eyes
Fuck no, I'm a bonafide Aquemini
Ooh, who are you hiding?
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you

Cheap booze, Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from 2002
Hot glue, vape juice
Hit undo, how the hell are you so cool?

Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 1]
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 2]
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

But you left, you're no longer here

The wind blows and it's told me about everything
With how many thorns have I cut myself to give you a thousand roses
And I cut myself for you
To make you happy
Mai', do you remember the day we met?
With no kisses, baby, we made love
We didn't undress, but we loved eachother
No matter what was our destiny

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 3]
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself

She said she believe in me, just keep on goin'
Just make sure when you get there, leave the door open
I said you know who I am, this kid from Brooklyn
I wish you still believed, even though tears are soaking

[Chorus]
Sucks to be you 'cause I woulda loved you
I'd watch the whole world burn to see you dance
Runnin' through cartels and jumpin' through bombshells
I thought we would die growin' old, holdin' hands
It sucks to be you 'cause I woulda loved you
I'd watch the whole world burn to see you dance
Jump over bombshells and runnin' through cartels
Thought we would die growin' old, holdin' hands

[Verse 2]
So I tell nobody 'bout my dreams, workin' at the hotel
'Cause I don't think confessions over there might go well
And goin' back to the hood means that I have course failed
You either kill or you're roadkill, so I said
Moved uptown, Kyra, she gave me a place to stay
Mama kicked me out back then, she did it ungraciously
Came home to all of the locks changed on New Year's Eve
I'm glad we're doin' better, we're both okay
I stayed there for like three years, oh, bless her heart and soul
She's worth a pot of gold
She's worth a thousand years in G-Wagons on the road
I made a promise, I keep it, won't ever betray those

[Pre-Chorus]
She said she believe in me, just keep on goin'
Just make sure when you get there, leave the door open
I said you know who I am, this kid from Brooklyn
I had abandonment issues, you left me broken

[Chorus]
Sucks to be you 'cause I woulda loved you
I'd watch the whole world burn to see you dance
Runnin' through cartels and jumpin' through bombshells
I thought we would die growin' old, holdin' hands
It sucks to be you 'cause I woulda loved you
I'd watch the whole world burn to see you dance
Jump over bombshells and runnin' through cartels
Thought we would die growin' old, holdin' hands

Chance The Rapper),"[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

SZA),"[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I like to say, ""What if?"", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh

[Verse 3: SZA]
Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (All this ass)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Had to keep the blicky on the hip (Uh)
Heard he in the party gettin' kicked (Okay)

[Verse 2: TyFontaine]
Party pack in my hands now
Geeked up and I ran out
Your bitch turned to a fan now
I step in and she fan out (Steppin')
Fuck the talkin', pull bands out
Now she walkin' with her ass out
She want my last, I'm 'bout to lash out
She ain't touchin' my stash house (Woo, woo)
Decapitated 'cause the head was immaculate
Numb in the toe, like what the fuck happenin'?
Nigga don't know, I'm out here stackin' it
Niggas don't know what they take and they vanishing
I talk my shit 'cause they don't think I'm backin' it
I talk my shit 'cause it really disgusts them (I talk my shit)
I talk my shit 'cause the thread is custom
And I talk my shit to the bitch when I'm bussin' her (Let's go)
Yo, huh, yeah, I'm with the gang right now (Yeah)
Niggas too lame right now (Ayy)
Fuck the cap and gown
I ain't need that to get the amount
In my accounts, without a doubt
Facin' the za, facin' a pound
And I break it down with the gang right now, go

[Chorus: Cochise]
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm with the gang right now (Right now)
No, I can't hang right now (Right now)
No way, lil' shawty look lame right now (Right now)
Need a AP plain right now (Right now)
Need a VV chain right now (Right now)
Need a blue ice ring right now (Right now)
That's my new lil' thing right now (Right now), yeah, yeah
Got a noodle shrimp with the stick (Stick)
When I'm runnin', I can never slip (Slip)
When they see me, wanna take a flick (Flick)
So much shawties, I can't even pick
But I picked already, so don't trip
I had to keep the blicky on the hip
Heard he in the party gettin' kicked (Right now, right now, right now)

Baby
He says
In these times', ma' (Ma')
We can't be together (Oh, yeah)
anxiety kills me
I want you close and period
I love you for me alone
It was not enough for me to see you in the little bed
This damn confinement is going to kill us
I can't wait anymore (Papi Juancho; Maluma baby)

[Chorus]
Because anxiety kills me, oh yeah
you became my need
being without you is going to kill me
It's just that I can't accept (Oh, yeah)
the power to have you
I don't want to be your friend na' má'
You are for me, nobody else (Say, say, say)

I try and try and I can't get my bearings
No matter how hard I try and I can't fall in love
I have looked for love everywhere
And all I do is crash

[Pre-Chorus]
How's it going? let yourself be seen
Your friends' told me, you want to see me
Forget the bad, forget yesterday
And after we do it, we're going to turn on
How's it going? let yourself be seen
Your friends' told me, you want to see me
Forget the bad, forget yesterday

[Chorus]
Because anxiety kills me, uh yeh
you became my need
being without you is going to kill me
It's just that I can't accept (No)
the power to have you
I don't want to be your friend na' má'
You are for me, nobody else (Say, say, say)

[Verse 2]
Hey baby I need you
If I don't have you, I weaken (Baby)
How much would I give to give you a little kiss (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
How's it going? let yourself be seen
Your friends' told me, you want to see me
Forget the bad, forget yesterday
And after we do it, we're going to turn on
How's it going? let yourself be seen
Your friends' told me, you want to see me
Forget the bad, forget yesterday (Haha)

Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)

I can't cum unless you kiss me

Never out in public 'cause they talk
Got a taste and got shell-shocked
Drive me to Hell in a drop-top

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Uh, drive me to Hell in a drop-top
I need you to save me 'fore I fuck up and go too far
I hate that you blame me for the things that I cannot control
I'm out here tryna make it work for us, it's too much
On my plate, got it all at stake
Say you hate me now, but you're at my place
Tell me lies, tell me that it's all okay
Tell me why you love me, even if it's fake

It's not fair
No matter what, I'm still gon' be here
It's hard for me to show you I care

Encore! Gave that bitch an encore
Fucked me like a freshman, but

Said she got that Glock in line
Yeah, what's your GPA
I'm in my Chevy bangin like I'm out of East LA
Them bricks be jumping fast
Call me a Chick-Fil-A
Your girl, I cut her ass just like I did today
If you dream it, live it
We young niggas living
YSL duffle, already know what's in it
I see No Limits: make em say uhh!
I see no niggas with this 100 round drum
Pullin out the club, you know I handle mine
Takin all these hatin niggas' bitches every time
Had to pop the trunk, pull out the chopper like it's magic
50 grand on my lap, poof! Like it's magic

Fishtailin' out the parkin' lot, leavin' Magic
2 bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sippin on the purple, any other drink magic

I'm awake ? cause I forgot to do my taxes
Called my accountant, he gonna make you do magic

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know me
You know I've never been a one woman man
Do not ask me to break your heart
You can't want me the way you want me
I told you clearly, I had already told you
Your body is only a whim for me (Hahaha)
And even though I know you're a woman, don't take it personal (Baby)

[Chorus]
Baby, you're asking the devil for heaven
You're asking me for the Sun when it's cold
Love for me isn't necessary
I should get out of your way
Baby, you're asking the devil for heaven
You're asking me for the Sun when it's cold
Love for me isn't necessary (No)
I should get out of your way, out of your way, yeah

[Verse 1]
I gave my love without measuring and I even lost my soul
Today you're suffering because of my traumas (Woo)
Although in your naked body I find peace (Rra)
When you kiss someone else, that is my karma
If you fall for me, then it's pointless
If I walk away, I'll do it for you (He)
I don't know who was the asshole that found Cupid
I don't fall for those fairytales anymore
Let's go to the party, mami
A bottle of Hennessy, and
Don't fall in love, ma, let's keep it like this
Dance for me, cause this one's for you and for me

[Chorus]
Baby, you're asking the devil for heaven
You're asking me for the Sun when it's cold
Love for me isn't necessary
I should get out of your way
Baby, you're asking the devil for heaven
You're asking me for the Sun when it's cold
Love for me isn't necessary (No)
I should get out of your way, out of your way, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you want something serious, please avoid it
If it's only sex, then ask for it
Call Papi Juancho and think about it
You know if it's only that then ask for it
But I won't promise another chapter
If you fall for me then it's pointless
If I walk away, I'll do it for you (He)
I don't know who was the asshole that found Cupid
I don't fall for those fairytales anymore
You know, mamacita, that

[Pre-Chorus]
I told you clearly, I had already told you
Your body is only a whim for me (Hahaha)

You're asking me for the Sun when it's cold

Papi Juancho

[Verse 1]
Her husband neglects her
She prepares him breakfast, but he doesn't say ""Good morning""
She goes out with her friends to forget about her life
Tequilas come and go
With that she gets entertained, baby (Mamacita)
With him she's a saint and with me evil
I'm going to make that son of a bitch the villan
That asshole's is going to pay for it
He doesn't touch you and does it on your face

[Chorus]
She's committed
And I see her confused
I'm her way out-out
She calls me to rescue her-her
She's committed
And I see her confused
I'm her way out-out
She calls me to rescue her-her

[Verse 2]
I'm her way out-out
She texts me so that I rescue her
He's the pawn, but here there's a checkmate
Your heart knows very well who it's beating for, that he doesn't even try it
You are my queen and I am your king
A movie and it's not Blu-Ray
I give you a thousand shades like Christian Gray
If I handcuff you, don't call the law

[Pre-Chorus]
Because we're just chillin', chillin'
While I touch you, you roll up the Phillie
We both know that he's kind of easy
Come with me 'case tonight we'll press delete, delete on him
Because we're just chillin', chillin'
While I touch you, you roll up the Phillie
We both know that he's kind of easy
Come with me 'case tonight we'll press delete, delete on him
(Maluma, baby)

[Chorus]
She's committed
And I see her confused
I'm her way out-out
She calls me to rescue her-her
She's committed
And I see her confused
I'm her way out-out
She calls me to rescue her-her

[Verse 3]
With only a look, she dominates me
She's a fan of adrenaline
She wets herself without a pool
With me she jumps, but in the streets she's a lady, divine

[Pre-Chorus]
Because we're just chillin', chillin'
While I touch you, you roll up the Phillie
We both know that he's kind of easy
Come with me 'cause tonight we'll press delete, delete on him
Because we're just chillin', chillin'
While I touch you, you roll up the Phillie
We both know that he's kind of easy
Come with me 'cause tonight we'll press delete, delete on him

I took her to a corner alone
I took her by the hand, we grinded in the dark

She had her clothes on while making love to me
Her friends saw us, but they never hid themselves
I called my friends, called my mates, and they quickly joined (Woo)

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
{Added in later versions -
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer}
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

One day good, another bad
That's how life is and it's not going to change
Sometimes to smile, you have to cry
Close your eyes and learn to fly, ah

And before this all ends
I'll live my life, if I die it'll be happy
And today I want alcohol and sex in excess
It's better to give you a kiss than to give you problems
And before this all ends
I'll live my life, if I die it'll be happy
And today I want alcohol and sex in excess
It's better to give you a kiss than to give you problems

[Verse 2]
A shot of love for the house on me
To celebrate that we breathe this smoke
Crying has never been a crime
And the rainy days are sometimes the most pretty
But today the sun came out and I feel better, eh-eh, eh
The bad passed, time is my doctor
Life is a movie, I'm my own director
Light-Light it up, and bring me alcohol
I don't have time to keep resentment
I don't pick fights anymore, and less if it's alcohol
Hug your brother and don't look at color, here we're all equals, eh
How much you love, that's what you're worth
Today I'm going to do a trick on the longboard but if it doesn't work (But if it doesn't work)

[Chorus]
And before this all ends
I'll live my life, if I die it'll be happy (Go on, go on)
And today I want alcohol and sex in excess
It's better to give you a kiss than to give you problems
And before this all ends
I'll live my life, if I die it'll be happy
And today I want alcohol and sex in excess
It's better to give you a kiss than to give you problems

You've got anxiety, you've got substance abuse, you've got, you know, and it's a lot of issues in the world to talk about
I don't know, music is just a beautiful thing, like I love myself so much, as far as the way I make music, the way God made me, the way God wired me to do the things that I do, and to change the world the way that I can
I think you're an agent of change, I think you're touchin' in a way this generation that very few, if no one else, can
Before I get up out of here, I wanna tell you that you can do anything you put your mind to, period

I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

In the jet at thirty-five thousand feet high (Yah)

[Chorus: Maluma]
But let's be carefull-a'u-a'u-a'u-a'u-a'u
Sex with protection, wow-wow-wow-wow
Protect your life, darling, to get in the line
This grinding is so that it's demanded

She catches on to me and pulls, but from the back
As if she didn't know it was going to happen
Hey, mami, give me a little bit of that
That way, we'll speed up the process
She catches on to me and pulls, but from the back
As if she didn't know it was going to happen
Hey, mami, give me a little bit of that
I'm a fan of your kisses (Ah)

[Verse 2: Yomo]
She feels the heat-heat-heat, she raises the temperature
Adiccted to twerking-ng, Yomo has the cure for her (Cure)
A little over five in height, her body is natural, she was born hot
She has a precise body, she never subtracts, she always adds
When they made her, mom, dad, they slammed the baseball (Mami, jeez)
Her face is pretty, her demeanor is that of a pretty face
She walks like a Goddess, precious, what a thing
Like the stuff under Medallo, she's pure without a cut
Go out to the streets at night to hunt, she made her sport
She walks with four babies, always accompanied-ed-ed (Haha)
With her mind damaged (-ed), with a steamy stare
She scratches my back when I give her the rod
Sweetness, tastiness, she bathes with me
Lust, we kill the rage, death dressed in black (Dressed in black)
In my bed we do mischief, on a dark night

[Chorus: Yomo]
She asks me to be careful-a'u-a'u-a'u-a'u with her (Hello)
Sex with protection, wow-wow-wow-wow
Protect your life, darling, to get in the line
This grinding is so that it's demanded
But be careful-a'u-a'u-a'u-a'u
Sex with protection, wow-wow-wow-wow

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Won't you stay inside?

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

[Verse 2]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

Drown my sorrows in this bottle
Won't like wakin' up tomorrow
I'm the only one that cares about myself
And you don't need me like I need you
So if I go, maybe I'll free you
But I'll be lost, to tell the truth, I need your help
And even you can't fix my problems
Like you once did, I'm too hollow
I can't talk to you no more and I can't tell
If it's me or if it's you, 'cause
You don't even pick up my calls no more
I'm drunk and left alone with all my thoughts

So maybe, maybe I'm drivin' me crazy
Maybe it's me and it's not you
I'm not too good at admitting when I fuck up

No way that I'll ever change
So I'm down to lay down next to my brain
I said I'm okay, but no way
It's more than I can take
And there's no one to blame but me
No need to wait for me
Why do you pick me up just to break me?
That's what you say to me
Why do you play with me?
You won't ever understand

Then beat my heart to black and blue

Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth

[Post-Chorus]
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) But even though you're killing me, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need you like the air I breathe
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need, I need you more than me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need you more than anything
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Please, please

[Outro]
'Cause I could be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I could be anything you need
As long as you don't leave

Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
